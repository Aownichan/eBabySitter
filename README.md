we are using react native for the frontend,for that you need to downlaod node.js first ( I downloaded v21.7.3) and then install react native by writing "npm install -g react-native-cli" in the command line.


In the main project folder,run npm install to install all necessary react native libraries.In the server directory run rest_api.py to start the server,make sure you install all the required libraries that are used in the file with pip install "library_name" 
after starting the python server,run the react native app by writing "npm start" and for now,just choose to run it in the web browser when it tells you (press w).
